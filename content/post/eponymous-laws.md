Eponymous laws are bits of joking wisdom named after someone.  Here are my favorites related to technology:

* **Amara's law:** "We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run."
* **Atwood's law:** Any software that can be written in JavaScript will eventually be written in JavaScript.
* **Brooks's law:** "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later."
* **Conway's law:** Any piece of software reflects the organizational structure that produced it.
* **Cunningham's law:** The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it’s to post the wrong answer.
* **Gall's law:** "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked."
* **Godwin's law:** an adage in Internet culture: "As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one."
* **Gustafson's law:** (also known as Gustafson–Barsis's law) in computer engineering: any sufficiently large problem can be efficiently parallelized.
* **Kerckhoffs's principle of secure cryptography:** A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public.
* **Koomey's law:** the energy of computation is halved every year and a half.
* **Kranzberg's laws of technology:** The first law states that technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.
* **Maes–Garreau law:** most favorable predictions about future technology will fall around latest possible date they can come true and still remain in the lifetime of the person making the prediction.
* **Metcalfe's law** in communications and network theory: the value of a system grows as approximately the square of the number of users of the system.
* **Mooers's law:** "An information retrieval system will tend not to be used whenever it is more painful and troublesome for a customer to have information than for him not to have it."
* **Moore's law:** is an empirical observation stating that the complexity of integrated circuits doubles every 24 months.
* **Nielsen's law:** A high-end user's internet connection speed grows by 50% per year.
* **Postel's law:** Be conservative in what you do; be liberal in what you accept from others.
* **Putt's law:** Technology is dominated by two types of people: those who understand what they do not manage and those who manage what they do not understand.
* **Putt's corollary:** Every technical hierarchy, in time, develops a competence inversion.
* **Reed's law:** the utility of large networks, particularly social networks, can scale exponentially with the size of the network.
* **Schneier's law:** "Any person can invent a security system so clever that she or he can't think of how to break it."
* **Sowa's law of standards:** "Whenever a major organization develops a new system as an official standard for X, the primary result is the widespread adoption of some simpler system as a de facto standard for X."[11]
* **Tesler's law of conservation of complexity:** states that every application has an inherent amount of complexity that cannot be removed or hidden.
* **Wirth's law:** Software gets slower more quickly than hardware gets faster.
* **Zawinski's law:** Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot expand are replaced by ones which can.
